# Employee_Tracker

For this project, I aim to create an Employee Tracker application that can be used to track the organization's employees.  This application will use MySQL, InquirerJs, and console.table dependencies to make the app function. My main motivation for this project is to create an application that will allow employers to successfully track their employees and view their information by department and role. 

# Acceptance Criteria

* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update employee roles

# Installation
In order to use this app, you will need to install MySQL, InquirerJs, and console.table.
